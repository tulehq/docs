title: console
description: "console 0.3.0: a web console for every Tule service."
---

A web console for [Tule](https://github.com/tulehq): browse every running
Tule service and do the everyday actions from one place. It is not an AWS
API and has no data of its own; it is a client of the other services,
calling each one's real API with the aws-sdk-go-v2 clients (and the signed
retrieval and inspection APIs of mailbox, queues and functions), signed with
the key you sign in with.

Each service it is pointed at gets a section: object-store's buckets,
secret-store's secrets, accounts' organization, identity's users, keys, roles and policies,
mailbox's messages and identities, queues' queues and functions' functions,
each bucket, secret, queue, function and email identity with its
resource-based policy. A console beside a lone object-store shows only
buckets.

## Running it

With Docker, pointed at services on the host:

```sh
docker run --rm -p 9070:9070 \
  -e TULE_Console_ObjectStoreEndpoint=http://host.docker.internal:9000 \
  -e TULE_Console_MailboxEndpoint=http://host.docker.internal:9040 \
  ghcr.io/tulehq/console:0.3.0
```

Then open `http://localhost:9070` and sign in. The image is based on Alpine
and runs as the unprivileged `nonroot` user. It holds no data and has no
volume, and its Docker health check polls `/_ready`.

From source (Go 1.27.4 or later):

```sh
make build
TULE_Console_ObjectStoreEndpoint=http://localhost:9000 ./build/tule-console
```

It listens on port 9070, after object-store's 9000, secret-store's 9010,
accounts' 9020, identity's 9030, mailbox's 9040, queues' 9050 and functions'
9060, so they can all run at once.

### Every service together, in Docker Compose

[`compose.yaml`](https://github.com/tulehq/console/blob/v0.3.0/compose.yaml) runs every service and the console, wired
together: one root key everywhere, every service pointed at identity so the
keys identity issues work on all of them, each held to its IAM policies, and
the console pointed at each. It pins the current release of every service.

```sh
docker compose up -d
DOCKER_GID=$(stat -c %g /var/run/docker.sock) docker compose --profile functions up -d
```

functions is behind the `functions` profile, since it runs function
containers through the Docker daemon and needs its socket and the socket's
group (`stat -f %g` on macOS); without it, the Functions section shows the
service as unreachable. The file in full:

## Configuration

Settings come from environment variables prefixed with `TULE_`, and from a
`.env` file in the working directory (without the prefix).

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `TULE_Console_ObjectStoreEndpoint` | unset | object-store's base URL, such as `http://localhost:9000`; set, the console has an Object store section |
| `TULE_Console_SecretStoreEndpoint` | unset | secret-store's base URL; the Secret store section |
| `TULE_Console_AccountsEndpoint` | unset | accounts' base URL; the Accounts section |
| `TULE_Console_IdentityEndpoint` | unset | identity's base URL; the Identity section, and the service sign-in asks |
| `TULE_Console_MailboxEndpoint` | unset | mailbox's base URL; the Mailbox section |
| `TULE_Console_QueuesEndpoint` | unset | queues' base URL; the Queues section |
| `TULE_Console_FunctionsEndpoint` | unset | functions' base URL; the Functions section |
| `TULE_Console_Region` | `us-east-1` | The region the console signs its calls for |
| `TULE_Console_SessionTTL` | `12h` | How long a session lasts from sign-in |
| `TULE_Console_SecureCookie` | `false` | Mark the session cookie `Secure` even on a plain-HTTP connection, for a console behind a TLS-terminating proxy. It is marked `Secure` on a TLS connection anyway |
| `TULE_Console_MaxSessions` | `10000` | The most sessions the console holds; at it, sign-in is refused until sessions end or expire |
| `TULE_Console_MaxSessionsPerKey` | `10` | The most sessions of one access key; a new one past it ends that key's oldest |
| `TULE_Console_TrustedProxies` | unset | Comma-separated CIDR prefixes (or addresses) of the proxies in front of the console, whose `X-Forwarded-For` the sign-in limiter reads. Unset, it is never read |
| `TULE_Server_Port` | `9070` | Listen port |
| `TULE_HSTS_MaxAge` | unset | `Strict-Transport-Security` max age; the header is only sent when set |
| `TULE_Server_ReadTimeout` | `5m` | How long the server may take to read a request, body included; an upload streams through it |
| `TULE_Server_ReadHeaderTimeout` | `30s` | How long it may take to read a request's headers; must be positive |
| `TULE_Server_WriteTimeout` | `5m` | How long it may take to write a response; a download streams through it |
| `TULE_Server_IdleTimeout` | `2m` | How long a keep-alive connection may sit idle between requests |
| `TULE_Server_ShutdownTimeout` | `7s` | How long a graceful shutdown waits for in-flight requests |
| `TULE_UI_Reload` | `false` | Build the templates on every page, as gas/ui's `ui.reload` |
| `TULE_GasEnv` | | `development` logs console output at trace level, `production` logs at warn level, `testing` disables logging |

At least one endpoint must be set; the console refuses to start without one.
Each is an absolute `http` or `https` URL. The console calls the services
server-side only, so an endpoint is the address the console reaches the
service at, such as `http://queues:9050` in Compose, not one the browser
needs to reach.

Logs go to the console only. They never hold a key: requests are logged by
method, path, status and time, never their query, form or cookie.

## Signing in

The sign-in page takes an access key ID, its secret, and, for a role
session, its session token. Every key a service accepts works: the root key
the services are configured with, a key identity issued to a user, and a
role session's key and token from identity's `AssumeRole`.

The console checks the key by making a signed call with it: identity's
`GetCallerIdentity` when identity is configured, which every principal may
call whatever its policies and which also names who signed in (shown at the
top of every page), and otherwise the cheapest read of the first configured
service, in the order of the configuration table (`ListBuckets`,
`ListSecrets`, `DescribeOrganization`, `GetAccount`, `ListQueues`,
`ListFunctions`). A key the service answers `401` or `403` to is refused; a
service that cannot be reached is reported as such, and the key is not
taken. Without identity, a read the service denies by policy, an
`AccessDenied` or `AccessDeniedException` in IAM's form ("User: \<arn\> is
not authorized to perform: ..."), still takes the key and names its
principal, since the services answer it only past the signature check. So a
key with no policies signs in either way, and is shown what it is denied.

On success the key is held server-side, in a session in memory. The
browser gets an opaque cookie, `tule_console_session`: a random session ID
and an HMAC of it under a key made at start, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`,
for the whole site, and `Secure` over TLS or with
`TULE_Console_SecureCookie`. The key never reaches the browser after
sign-in; pages show the principal's ARN, or the last four characters of an
AWS-length key ID when the console could not ask identity. Signing out, or
the session's `TULE_Console_SessionTTL` passing, drops the key.

**Sessions live in memory.** A restart, which also makes a new cookie key,
signs everyone out. Sessions are not shared between two consoles.

Every request but sign-in, the static files, the probes, `/favicon.ico`
(always `404`; pages declare no icon) and `/robots.txt` (which disallows
everything) needs a session. A signed-out page the browser opens is sent to
sign-in, and comes back to it after; an HTMX request is told to go there;
anything else, a form post, an asset or a background fetch, gets `401`
without a redirect, so it never loads the sign-in page behind an open form.
The sign-in form's token lasts an hour and is kept while it does: opening
the sign-in page again, in a tab or by a background request, leaves an
open form's token good. Signing in again from a signed-in browser ends its old session.
A key holds at most `TULE_Console_MaxSessionsPerKey` sessions, its oldest
ending when it signs in past that, and the console at most
`TULE_Console_MaxSessions`, past which sign-in is refused with a message
saying so: refusing keeps one key's sign-ins from ending everyone else's
sessions.

Signing in is limited per client: ten failed attempts, then one more every
six seconds; successful sign-ins do not count. A client is an IPv4
address, or an IPv6 address's /64. **With no trusted proxies, the client is
the connection's peer address**, so behind a proxy, or Docker Desktop's
port forwarding, every client shares the proxy's limit: set
`TULE_Console_TrustedProxies` to the proxy's addresses, and the client is
the rightmost `X-Forwarded-For` hop that is not one of them. The limiter
remembers the 100,000 clients seen last.

When the service that checks the key cannot be reached or fails, the
sign-in page says which service, and the console's log has the detail;
signed-in error pages show the service's own message.

## Sections

Every page has a stable URL. Pages work without JavaScript; with it, htmx
adds search as you type and in-place answers for revealing a secret and
invoking a function. Each page shows when its service is not ready (its
`/_ready`, probed at most every five seconds) or does not answer, and a
call that fails shows the service's error code and message on the section's
error page instead of a broken one.

Actions are plain form posts that come back to the page with a message of
what happened, or what the service answered when it did not. Deleting asks
first, with JavaScript on.

### Permissions

Every service evaluates identity's policies for the keys identity issued,
with the resource-based policy of what the request acts on where the
service has one ([Resource policies](#resource-policies)); the root key is
always allowed. A principal of another account, such as a member account's
role session, is allowed only what a resource policy shares with it besides
its own identity policies; accounts lets it call only
`DescribeOrganization`.
The console asks for nothing beyond what each page needs and shows what the
service answers: a page the signed-in principal may not read shows that
service's `AccessDenied` (or `AccessDeniedException`) and its message, with
the service's status, `403`, or `400` for secret-store and accounts. An htmx
answer, such as a search, a reveal or an invocation filter, is the refusal
alone, swapped where the answer was to go. An action that is denied comes
back to its page with the message.

The pages that read a service's inspection API rather than its AWS API also
need Tule's own action `tule:Inspect` on
`arn:aws:<service>:<region>:<account>:*`: mailbox's messages and rendering
failures (`ses`), queues' list and queue pages (`sqs`), and functions'
invocations and each function's last invocations (`lambda`). A policy such
as `{"Effect": "Allow", "Action": ["sqs:*", "tule:Inspect"], "Resource":
"*"}` grants a section and its inspection pages. A function's page without
`tule:Inspect` shows its configuration and says why its invocations are
missing.

### Resource policies

A bucket's, secret's, queue's and function's page has a Policy section, and
an email identity's page its sending authorization policies. The section
shows the stored policy as indented JSON in a textarea to edit and save
with the service's own operation, and a delete; a resource without one has
an empty form with an example naming the resource. Saving sends the
document as it was typed. A document the service refuses, such as
object-store's `MalformedPolicy` or secret-store's `PublicPolicyException`,
is shown next to the form with the service's code and message, and the
form keeps the document as it was sent.

**A change made since the page was loaded is never lost.** Each form sends
back the version of the policy the page read (a SHA-256 of the stored
document, empty for none), and the console reads the policy again before it
writes. One that changed, whether another client replaced it, added a
statement with `AddPermission` or deleted it, refuses the save or delete
with `409`, "The policy changed since the page was loaded", next to the
form, which keeps the document as sent and shows the stored one below it.
Saving again from that answer replaces the policy as it is now. A
function's policy is guarded by its `RevisionId` instead. The check and the
write are two calls, so a change in between is not caught; creating a named
sending authorization policy is not checked, since mailbox refuses a name
the identity has, and removing one statement by its `Sid` is not checked.

A policy the signed-in principal may not read, such as without
`s3:GetBucketPolicy`, shows the service's `AccessDenied` in the section's
place, and the rest of the page is shown; a save or delete it may not make
is shown next to the form the same way. Since a save reads the policy
first, a principal that may change a policy but not read it is refused.

| Page | Read | Save | Delete | Also |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bucket, at its root | `GetBucketPolicy` | `PutBucketPolicy` | `DeleteBucketPolicy` | |
| Secret | `GetResourcePolicy` | `PutResourcePolicy` | `DeleteResourcePolicy` | "Validate" runs `ValidateResourcePolicy` and shows its findings, storing nothing; a `BlockPublicPolicy` box, checked to begin with |
| Queue | `GetQueueAttributes` `Policy` | `SetQueueAttributes` `Policy` | `SetQueueAttributes` with an empty `Policy` | Each statement listed; one with a `Sid` is removed with `RemovePermission` |
| Function | `GetPolicy` | `PutResourcePolicy` | `DeleteResourcePolicy` | Each statement listed and removable with `RemovePermission`; every change sends the `RevisionId` the page read, so a policy changed since is refused with `PreconditionFailedException` |
| Email identity | `GetEmailIdentityPolicies` | `CreateEmailIdentityPolicy` for a new name, `UpdateEmailIdentityPolicy` for one it has | `DeleteEmailIdentityPolicy` | Every named policy in a form of its own, and a form to add one by name |

Each statement is listed with its `Sid`, effect, principal, action,
resource and condition. Statements are added through the document: there
is no form for `AddPermission`, though the console lists and removes the
statements it writes. A secret scheduled for deletion has no Policy
section, as secret-store answers it nothing until it is restored.

### Object store

`/s3`: the buckets; create a bucket. A bucket's page browses it by prefix,
with folders for the common prefixes and 200 entries a page; select objects
to delete them; delete the bucket, which object-store refuses unless it is
empty. Upload a file into the current prefix, under its own name or a key
you give, with the file's content type or one you give: the upload streams
through the console in 8 MiB parts (one `PutObject`, or a multipart upload
beyond 8 MiB), so the console never holds a whole file, and a session runs
at most two uploads at once. An object's page has
its size, ETag, type, headers and user metadata, and a download that
streams it through the console.

### Secret store

`/secrets`: every secret, scheduled deletions included, searched by words
of its name and description (secret-store filters nothing, so the console
reads up to 5000 secrets and filters them); create a secret. A secret's page
has its metadata, tags and versions with their staging labels. No value is
read until you reveal it: the current one, or any version's. Put a new
value (it becomes `AWSCURRENT`), delete with a recovery window of 7 to 30
days or at once without recovery, and restore a secret scheduled for
deletion.

### Accounts

`/accounts`: the organization and its tree of the root, organizational
units and accounts, with each account's email and state; create the
organization when there is none; create an account (it joins the root) or
an organizational unit under any root or unit. An account's page has its
details, parent and tags.

### Identity

`/iam`: the IAM users, 50 a page, with each one's access keys, their
status, creation and last use; create a user. A user's page has its keys
and tags: create a key, whose secret is shown on that one answer only (as
AWS does; the page is not cached and htmx keeps it out of history),
activate, deactivate and delete keys, and delete the IAM user, which identity
refuses while it has keys or policies.

A user's page also has its policies. Each inline policy opens on a page of
its own with the document, decoded and indented, to edit and save
(`PutUserPolicy`) or delete; "Add inline policy" opens the same form empty,
and refuses a name the user's inline policies already have rather than
replace that policy. Attached managed policies can be detached, and any of
the account's or AWS's managed policies attached from a list (up to 1000),
or by ARN when the list cannot be read or is cut at 1000.

`/iam/roles`: the roles, 50 a page. Create a role with its name, path,
description, maximum session duration and trust policy, which starts as
trusting the signed-in account. A role's page has its details, its trust
policy, and its inline and attached policies, changed as a user's are;
delete it, which identity refuses while it has policies.

`/iam/policies`: the managed policies, AWS's and the account's, 50 a page,
with their attachment counts. Create a customer managed policy with its
name, path, description and document. A policy's page has its details and
its default version's document; delete it, which identity refuses while it
is attached or has other versions. AWS's policies offer no delete.

A document identity refuses, such as `MalformedPolicyDocument`, is shown
next to its form with the service's code and message and the document as it
was typed, so nothing is lost. A list on a user's or role's page the
principal may not read says so in its place, and the rest of the page is
shown. The section shows what identity allows the signed-in principal: a
user without IAM permissions sees identity's `AccessDenied`.

### Mailbox

`/mail/identities`: the email identities, with their type, verification and
whether sending is enabled. An identity's page has its details and its
sending authorization policies ([Resource policies](#resource-policies)).

`/mail`: the messages, newest first, with every filter mailbox's retrieval
API has (from, to, subject, full-text search, since and until, read in
UTC, configuration set, tags as `name:value` separated by commas, and
MessageId), 50 a page; delete every message. A message's page has its
recipients, tags, the text part, the HTML part in a preview frame, every
header, its attachments to download, and its raw MIME to read or save as
`.eml`; delete it. `/mail/failures` lists the rendering failures, filtered
by template, MessageId and time.

### Queues

`/sqs`: the queues with their visible, in-flight and delayed counts;
create a standard or FIFO queue (`.fifo` is added to a FIFO queue's name),
with content-based deduplication. A queue's page has its attributes and its
messages through queues' inspection API, which does not change them,
filtered by state and message group; send a message with a body,
`Name=Value` String attributes, and a delay, or a group and deduplication
ID on a FIFO queue; purge the queue; delete it.

### Functions

`/lambda`: the functions with their state, package type, memory and
timeout. A function's page has its configuration and environment, its
event source mappings, its last invocations, and invoke: a JSON payload
runs it synchronously, and the page shows its status, result and the tail
of its log. `/lambda/invocations` is functions' invocation history,
filtered by function, status, source and time, and each invocation's page
has its payload, result and whole log. `/lambda/mappings` lists every event
source mapping, each enabled or disabled from there.

## Security

- **Escaping.** Every page is an `html/template` page through gas/ui, and
  no template function returns a trusted type, so every name, key, subject,
  body, header and value a service answers is escaped for where it lands.
  The tests render hostile names, keys, subjects and bodies in every section
  and check the parsed page runs nothing.
- **Mail HTML** is the only HTML of a service the console shows, and only
  in an `<iframe sandbox="">` (no scripts, no same origin, no forms, no
  popups), served from its own URL with
  `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; base-uri 'none'; form-action 'none'; frame-ancestors 'self'; sandbox`,
  so it loads nothing, images and styles included, and runs sandboxed even
  when opened outside the frame. It is served with `Referrer-Policy:
  no-referrer`.
- **Downloads** (objects, attachments, saved `.eml`) are
  `Content-Disposition: attachment`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, and
  under the same `default-src 'none'; sandbox` policy, so no object renders
  on the console's origin whatever its type. A raw message to read is
  `text/plain` under that policy.
- **Pages** carry `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self';
  script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data:; frame-src
  'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; form-action 'self'; base-uri 'none';
  object-src 'none'`: no inline script or style, and no page of the console
  in another site's frame. htmx runs with `allowEval`, `allowScriptTags`,
  its inline indicator styles and its history cache off, so a revealed
  value or a new key's secret is not kept in the browser's storage.
- **CSRF.** Every state-changing request is a POST and needs the session's
  CSRF token, in the `_csrf` form field (the first field of an upload) or
  the `X-CSRF-Token` header htmx sends, beside Gas's cross-origin
  protection, which refuses a cross-site browser request outright. The
  sign-in form has a token of its own in a cookie for the sign-in path.
- **Static files** are embedded in the binary: one stylesheet, a small
  script, and htmx 2.0.11 from its npm package, unmodified, with its
  license and checksums in [third_party/htmx](https://github.com/tulehq/console/tree/v0.3.0/third_party/htmx). Nothing is
  loaded from a CDN.

## Health checks

`GET /_health` (liveness) and `GET /_ready` (readiness) answer without a
session. They respond `200` when every part of the console reports healthy
or ready and `503` otherwise, with a JSON object of each one's status.
Readiness does not depend on the services the console shows; each section
shows its service's own readiness.

## Limits

- Sessions are in memory, as above.
- The Functions section's end-to-end tests run against a functions
  checkout and a Docker daemon when both are there, and are skipped
  otherwise.
- Out of scope: policy versions beyond the default's document, editing a
  role's trust policy after it is created, creating and deleting email
  identities, a form for `AddPermission`, groups, permissions boundaries
  and the rest of IAM beyond users, roles, keys and policies, the rarely
  used operations of each API, and views across accounts beyond what the
  signed-in principal's calls return.
